# Garden Automation

This is a system that I designed to help with my gardening using the very extensive help available online. I am posting my work here so that it could help others in some way like other's work help me build this project.

## System Overview
Final objective of this project is to build a gardening system, involving one or more connected devices, with average intelligence to help out with my reapeated task like watering the plants because I have seen my plant suffer whenever I go on vacations.

Right now I have added following capabilities to the project:

1. Light intesity detection using LDR sensor.
2. Humidity and temperature sensor using DHT sensor.
3. Different LEDs which can be used for providing feedback like system is running, pump is working, etc.
4. Nokia 5110 LCD screen to display information like -
    1. LDR reading
    2. Temperature 
    3. Humidity
    4. Status of pump
5. I have added 3 submersible water pumps as per my requirement but those can be added as per anybody's requirement.
6. Email to be sent whenever the pump completes watering the plant.


**Note:** *To successfully run the project please create the local.py and add all respective variables used in the project there. I haven't included that file for security reasons.*
